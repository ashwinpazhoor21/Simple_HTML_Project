# Simple HTML Project

## Description

This project, created a couple of years ago, was my introduction to the basics of HTML and CSS. The website provides information about soccer, one of my favorite sports that I enjoy playing in my free time. The main file, **"soccer_info.html,"** serves as the central hub, with all other files linked to it. Additionally, there is an SCSS file that has been compiled to CSS using Sass.

## Reflection

Working on this project was a foundational experience in web development. It allowed me to explore the fundamental concepts of structuring content with HTML and styling it with CSS. By choosing soccer as the theme, I was able to combine my passion for the sport with my interest in coding, making the learning process more engaging and enjoyable.

The experience of converting SCSS to CSS using Sass introduced me to the power of preprocessors in web development. This project not only strengthened my understanding of front-end technologies but also sparked a deeper interest in creating and designing web pages. Looking back, it was a crucial step in my journey towards becoming proficient in web development, and it continues to inspire me to explore more advanced topics and technologies.
